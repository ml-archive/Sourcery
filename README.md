Sorcery is a framework that simplifies `UITableView` setup and makes your life easier by not requiring you to write hundreds of lines of code just to setup simple (and complex) table views. It contains multiple classes that can't be used for different purposes, ranging from displaying search results to complex table views consisting of many cells and different cell types.
